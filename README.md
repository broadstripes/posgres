# postgres
This Dockerfile builds FROM the official Postgres docker-library and acts just like it, except that PL/Perl and PostGIS have been built into the image.

The full readme is generated over in [docker-library/docs](https://github.com/docker-library/docs),
specificially in [docker-library/docs/postgres](https://github.com/docker-library/docs/tree/master/postgres).
